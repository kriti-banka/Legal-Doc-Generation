  "about":"Legal notice for recovery of money is a formal intimation between two people warning the other before legal action is initiated to get their due payment. Believe it or not, you can also send a legal notice for recovery of money from a friend, in case he/she owes you a lot. To recover money from people who owe it to you, the role and importance of a legal notice for recovery of due becomes important. Legal notice for refund of money can be filed for anyone from a dealer to an employee, tenant, friend, company, bank, etc. One may send a notice for recovery of money from your employer, friend or any other party who owes you money. The first step in recovery should be to send a legal notice since most recovery cases get resolved in this step itself and you do not need to proceed to Court. One must send a well-drafted and legally sound notice to ensure that you get a prompt response on your notice and you have maximum opportunity to recover your money.",
